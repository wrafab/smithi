  <h3>
    This week, we worked with the 3D printers to make three different projects. One allowed us to experiment with an Autodesk program 
    called Meshmixer. We also worked with Fusion 360 to make our other projects, one was any object that could not be made with 
    subtractive manufacturing (a.k.a. a drill, basically), and the other was any useful object.

    The printers in our Makerspace are Makerbot Replicator 5th Gen 3D Printers. They use a process called Fused Filament Modeling (FFM), 
    also known as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).
    
    Our printers - Fused Filament or Fused Deposition Modeling FFM or FDM. 
      Use an extruder to extrude filament - PLA 
    Constraints - 45 degree upward angele is the threshold for 3D printing without supports
    you want detailed stuff closer to the base
