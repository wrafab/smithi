  <h4> Challenge 1: Golf Ball Drop </h4>
  <h3> 
    In this challenge, we were given twelve straws and some tape and instructed to create a contraption that would catch and hold a golf ball
    dropped into it from a height of six feet. In our group, we created a cradle-like structure, utilizing the bending point of the straw as 
    the bottom of the cradle. Since only three straws were permitted to touch the ground at once, we created legs on two sides and cut a straw 
    in half lengthwise to run along the bottom such that only three straws would be touching. Our greatest challenge was the limited amount of
    tape, but we managed to overcome this by holding the straws together with the smallest possible bits of tape.

  <h3> 
    Our design was not particularly effective, but it was probably one of the more effective designs in the class. When the golf ball was
    dropped into our cradle, it took a moment or two to bounce or roll out, but on each of the three attempts, the golf ball did not ever
    remain in the cradle.

  <h3>
    I was active throughout the entire design process, and I would say that the work done by my team during this challenge was truly 
    a group effort. We all contributed to all the ideas of how to construct our contraption, and everyone was active in the building 
    phase, as well. Personally, I think I was slightly more active in building than in designing, but I definitely contributed to the
    design, too.

  <h4> Challenge 2: Newspaper Towers </h4>
  <h3> 
   In this challenge, we were given a single issue of a newspaper and some tape and told to build the highest tower possible. Our team 
    chose to build a tower out of interlocked rolled sheets, with a base made up of a cone shape. This design was especially useful 
    because it required an exceptionally minimal amount of tape. Our only major challenge in this endeavor was determining when to stop 
    building and finding the balance between height and stability.

  <br>
  <h3> 
    Our tower was the tallest in the class, with a final measurement of 88 inches tall. Our structure was very effective because of the 
    strength of rolled cylinders and the structural integrity that comes with having a wide base. It helped that we rolled our newspaper 
    diagonally in order to increase the height added with each new roll of paper, and thus decreased the amount of weight added to the 
    top of our tower.It also helped that we made each consecutive roll a slightly different thickness such that we could insert each new 
    roll into the previous one. This decreased our tape usage and added to the stability of our tower.

  <h3>
    I was active through the entire process. This challenge was great for my team because we worked very well together and hardly had to 
    discuss our plans for our structure. After a few minutes of discussion at the beginning, we were all on the same page as far as what 
    needed done, and so we all worked together to build our very beautiful, very tall tower. The only thing my team really had any 
    disagreement on was towards the end when we debated whether to add more rolls to the top of our tower. I wanted to add more because 
    I believed our tower was strong enough to take it, but my teammates did not want to take the risk. Eventually, we compromised and 
    topped our tower off with a half roll.
