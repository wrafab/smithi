  <h4> Challenge 1: Golf Ball Drop </h4>
  <h3> 
    In this challenge, we were given twelve straws and some tape and instructed to create a contraption that would catch and hold a golf ball
    dropped into it from a height of six feet. In our group, we created a cradle-like structure, utilizing the bending point of the straw as 
    the bottom of the cradle. Since only three straws were permitted to touch the ground at once, we created legs on two sides and cut a straw 
    in half lengthwise to run along the bottom such that only three straws would be touching. Our greatest challenge was the limited amount of
    tape, but we managed to overcome this by holding the straws together with the smallest possible bits of tape.

  <h3> 
    Our design was not particularly effective, but it was probably one of the more effective designs in the class. When the golf ball was
    dropped into our cradle, it took a moment or two to bounce or roll out, but on each of the three attempts, the golf ball did not ever
    remain in the cradle.
