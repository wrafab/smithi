  <h3>
    This week, we used the laser engraver to create four different projects. We created clocks, press fit kits, a choice project, and 
    water bottles. As with the printers last week, we used CorelDRAW to create our projects. The most important thing you will learn 
    from my projects this week, if you had not already picked up on this from previous weeks, is that I am a nerd.

  <h4>
    Assignment 1: Clock
  </h4>
  <h3>
    We created clocks to be hung on the wall of the Makerspace. The only requirements were that it be original and compatible with 
    a specific clock kit we had.

  <h3>
    Because I love to listen to 80s music, and one of my favorite 80s bands is Journey, I decided to try to make a clock out of one 
    of their most iconic album covers, Escape. Because I was not especially familiar with CorelDRAW's Trace Bitmap tool when I first 
    started on this project, I had to restart several times before I finally figured out exactly how to make my clock look like I 
    wanted it to.

  <h3>
    Before I put my image into CorelDRAW, I used another application to convert it to grayscale, then I put that grayscale image into 
    CorelDRAW and traced the bitmap. From there, I had to go through and decide which parts of the bitmap I actually wanted to engrave 
    and which parts I wanted to remove. I decided to remove all the letters and background, leaving only the iconic orb and scarab beetle 
    in my clock. I also didn't want my clock to be super dark everywhere, so I removed as much of the background as I could. This took a 
    lot of time, because I had to go through every one of the almost 300 "curves," as CorelDRAW labels them, in the bitmap of my image. 
    Once I accomplished that, though, I was ready to laser engrave.
