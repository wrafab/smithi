  <h3>
    This week, we used the laser engraver to create four different projects. We created clocks, press fit kits, a choice project, and 
    water bottles. As with the printers last week, we used CorelDRAW to create our projects. The most important thing you will learn 
    from my projects this week, if you had not already picked up on this from previous weeks, is that I am a nerd.

  <h4>
    Assignment 1: Clock
  </h4>
  <h3>
    We created clocks to be hung on the wall of the Makerspace. The only requirements were that it be original and compatible with 
    a specific clock kit we had. 
  </h3>
  <br>
  <p style = "text-align:center;"> <img src = "Clocks on Wall.JPG" alt = "Clocks on the Wall" width = 450> </p>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Because I love to listen to 80s music, and one of my favorite 80s bands is Journey, I decided to try to make a clock out of one 
    of their most iconic album covers, Escape. Because I was not especially familiar with CorelDRAW's Trace Bitmap tool when I first 
    started on this project, I had to restart several times before I finally figured out exactly how to make my clock look like I 
    wanted it to. 
  </h3>

   <p style = "text-align:center;"> <img src = "Journey Escape Album Cover Better.jpg" alt = "Journey Escape Album Cover" width = 500> </p>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Before I put my image into CorelDRAW, I used another application to convert it to grayscale, then I put that grayscale image into 
    CorelDRAW and traced the bitmap. From there, I had to go through and decide which parts of the bitmap I actually wanted to engrave 
    and which parts I wanted to remove. I decided to remove all the letters and background, leaving only the iconic orb and scarab beetle 
    in my clock. I also didn't want my clock to be super dark everywhere, so I removed as much of the background as I could. This took a 
    lot of time, because I had to go through every one of the almost 300 "curves," as CorelDRAW labels them, in the bitmap of my image. 
    Once I accomplished that, though, I was ready to laser engrave.

  <br>
  <h3>
    I am very satisfied with how my clock turned out. Because of my inexperience with CorelDRAW, I honestly did not expect my clock 
    to turn out so well, so when I saw the final product and how much it really looked like my original image, despite the background 
    being edited out, I was very pleased. If I were to do this project again, I would not change anything. I would just be faster in 
    creating my clock, because of all my new experience with CorelDRAW.

  <h4> Assignment 2: Press Fit Kits </h4>
  <br>
  <h3>
    "What is a press fit kit?" you ask. "Well," I tell you, "it is a collection of shapes that fit together by means of slits and which 
    do not fall apart because those slits are tight enough that friction holds the pieces in place.
    <br>
    We had to create press fit kits out of at least three different shapes. Because I am a nerd, I created a kit with 6 different shapes 
    and 9 different pieces and I named it the Fellowship of the Shapes. 
  </h3>
  <br>
  <p style = "text-align:center;"> <img src = "shapes file screenshot.JPG" alt = "Fellowship of the Shapes" width = 500> </p>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Creating these shapes was pretty easy. I made the 9 shapes on CorelDRAW, each approximately the same size, with my hexagon and 
    pentagons slightly smaller because they represented my dwarf and my hobbits. I used a caliper to measure the thickness of my 
    cardboard, and then created slits in my shapes of that width, so that my shapes would fit together.

  </p>
  <br>
  <h3> Finally, I found grayscale 
    images of my 9 characters, converted them to bitmaps using CorelDRAW, and put them on their respective shapes. from there, I was 
    ready to print.

  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>
    My shapes turned out very well. They all stuck together correctly, and I was very proud of my nerdiness when I was finished. 
    The only thing I would change would be that some of my images turned out strangely because my images were so dark that the 
    laser cut through the top layer of cardboard, which made my image look very strange, but other than brightening up some of my 
    images to solve that problem, there is nothing I would change if I were to make this again.

    Assignment 3: Living Hinge
  </h4>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Of the several options given for this part of the assignment, I found living hinges the most interesting, so I decided to try to
     make one. A living hinge is simply a piece of material with enough small cuts in it to theoretically not make the material fall 
    apart but to still allow it to flex freely. I decided to just create a geometric pattern which would divide my material into small 
    pieces, and then use CorelDRAW's virtual segment delete tool to remove small pieces of each of those cuts to hold the entire piece 
    together.

  <br>
  <h3>
    My living hinge turned out very well. There were a few pieces that fell out, but that was only because, since my piece was so large, 
    I did not use the virtual segment delete tool on all the pieces because I missed several of them. However, the piece flexes very well 
    and has yet to fall apart. I am very pleased with the results.

  <h4>
    Assignment 4: Water Bottle
  </h4>
  <br>
  <h3>
    For our final assignment this week, we had to use the rotary attachment for the laser cutter to engrave either a water bottle or a 
    glass. This project was different from the others because, if we wanted to put images, the laser cutter could only do two colors 
    because instead of cutting through various depths to create various shades, as the laser could do on wood or cardboard, on the water 
    bottle, the laser could only cut away the paint on top of the stainless steel. Because of this, the only colors available to me were 
    the blue of the water bottle's paint and the silver of the stainless steel. Thus, instead of putting NASA's iconic "Meatball" logo 
    on my water bottle, which would have required more than those two colors, I put NASA's simpler "Worm" logo on my water bottle, as 
    well as a quote from Gene Kranz, one of NASA's best-known and most inspirational flight directors.
  </h3>

    <img src = "nasa worm logo.png" alt = "Worm!" width = 800 style = "margin:25px 25px">
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>
    I am very happy with how my water bottle turned out. I would change absolutely nothing. The blue goes perfectly with my theme 
    because, although I did not use the Meatball logo in my water bottle, the blue of the water bottle is very similar to the blue 
    of the Meatball logo. The words turned out very clear on my bottle, and the whole piece is very aesthetically pleasing.

    In this file, you will notice that the words are rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This is simply because of the orientation 
    of the rotary attachment and water bottle in the laser engraver.
