  <h1> Sewing and Embroidery </h1>
  <h2> <i> 10 - 16 November 2018 </i> </h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    This week, we made hats and pillowcases using embroidery and sewing, respectively. 
  </h3>
  <br>
  <h4> Assignment 1: Embroidered Hat </h4>
  <h3> In embroidery, a backing is necessary to hold all the stitches in place and provide stability so the fabric does not move 
    or pucker while stitching. For this project, we used a cut-away backing on the inside of the hat and a water soluble backing 
    on the outside of the hat in order to preserve appearances. We used the Tajima embroidery machine to embroider our hats.

    I am very satisfied with how my hat turned out. I think I chose good size and color for my text, and the hat itself is very warm.

  <h4> Assignment 2: Pillowcase </h4>
  <h3> We also made "burrito" pillowcases this week. I chose to make a Captain America - themed one for my little brother for 
    Christmas. Since I have used sewing machines before, that part of the process was not all that challenging. I did find it 
    difficult, though, to make the edges exactly square and to pin things where they needed to be pinned. I had also never done 
    a French seam before, so it was neat to learn that new way of sewing. A French seam is a kind of seam where the seam is hidden 
    on both the inside and outside. </h3>
